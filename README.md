### Setup

#### Configuring MongoDB

- create an .env file on the top level of this repo with the following information:
  ``` 
  PORT=3000
  HOST=localhost:3000
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth-server
  ```

  You can optionally add the following:
  ```
  TIME_SENSITIVE=true
  ONE_TIME_TOKEN=true
  ```

  `TIME_SENSITIVE` causes tokens to expire 15 minutes. `ONE_TIME_TOKEN` only lets tokens be used once before they expire. Note that because .env values are strings, writing in `true` produces a string 'true', not a boolean. That means having any value assigned to the feature (other than a blank) will enable it.

- start your database with the path of the DB along with the folder location for your DB files (`mongod --dbpath=/Users/path/to/data/db`: i.e. `"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="D:\db"`)
- install node packages locally with `npm i` from the root directory in Terminal
- start the server with `nodemon index.js`

**Note:** for Heroku deployment, `MONGODB_URI` needs to have a value filled out in settings. The mLab add-on handles this automatically by filling out the variable and giving you a MongoDB to use.
As of this revision, you need to put in the HOST variable as well. 

#### Tests

- Testing command: `npm test` from root directory
